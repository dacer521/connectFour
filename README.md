AP CSP submission project

This project is something I created for my AP Computer Science Principles submission.

This project will be used on the test so I can get AP credit, and scored for having several elements such as a procedure, and data structure such as a list or array.

There are no comments becuase they are not permitted on the AP test, and this project is created adhering to the rules set by collegeboard for this exam.

The program can be played with 1 player against a (incredibly stupid) AI, which will move randomly, or against a friend! (highly reccomended).

I also added color because I can. I made it terminal based also because I can.
